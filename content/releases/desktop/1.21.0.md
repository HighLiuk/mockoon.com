## Dialogs default directory

Until now, the save and open dialogs were pointing by default on a fresh install to the folder containing the binary. This folder may be wiped on some systems at each update which could cause data loss.
The dialogs now opens to the application's data folder and save their current working directory like it should. (Issue [#756](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/756))

## Templating helpers

We added a new [`parseInt`](https://mockoon.com/docs/latest/templating/mockoon-helpers/#parseInt) helper. (Issue [#766](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/766))

## Fixes

- The `date` helper is now compatible with other helpers like the `queryParam`. (Issue [#781](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/781))
- Serving a file with an unknown mime type now correctly revert to the environment Content-Type. (Issue [#785](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/785))
- Duplicating a route to an environment now corretly save the new route in the environment JSON file. (Issue [#790](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/790))
- **⚠️ Breaking change**: `setVar` helper has been reworked and is not breaking anymore when used inside an `each`. The usage of variables is also uniformized and now requires an `@`. See the [documentation](https://mockoon.com/docs/latest/templating/mockoon-helpers/#setvar) for more information. (Issue [#793](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/793))

## Improvements

- We improved the menus resizer visibility. (Issue [#729](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/729))
- `text/xml` content type is now suggested in the header autocomplete menu and is correctly enabling the editor syntax highlighting. (Issue [#798](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/issues/798))
