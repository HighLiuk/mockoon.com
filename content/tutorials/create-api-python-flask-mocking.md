In this guide, you will learn how to create a basic REST API using [Flask microframework](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) for Python. Flask is one of the most popular and easy-to-use Python libraries for API creation.

> Before continuing, you can learn more about REST APIs in general, how they work, their components, etc. in our [series of tutorials](/articles/api-guide-what-are-api/)

Creating an API using this library is easy, straightforward, and only requires the following basic steps.

## 1. Initialize your new Python application

To create a simple API using Flask, we first need to verify that Python and pip are installed by running the following commands:

```sh-sessions
$ python --version
Python 3.10.4
```

```sh-sessions
$ pip --version
pip 22.0.4 from /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/pip (python 3.10)
```

Go to [Python's website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to install Python and pip if one of the above commands is unsuccessful.

After verifying that Python and pip are installed, you can install flask by running the following command:

```sh-sessions
$ pip install flask
Collecting flask
...
Successfully installed Jinja2-3.1.1 MarkupSafe-2.1.1 Werkzeug-2.1.1 click-8.1.2 colorama-0.4.4 flask-2.1.1 itsdangerous-2.1.2
```

## 2. Create a Flask web server

Before coding our Flask server, we first need to create a new python file. Let's name it `api.py` and create it in a new folder of your choice.

In this file, we need to import the `Flask` class from the Flask library by using Python's `import` command:

```python
from flask import Flask
```

It will allow us to instantiate and run a web server instance.

We can now instantiate a new webserver instance by using the `Flask` class we previously imported, and pass the current module name:

```python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__);
```

## 3. Add API routes and return JSON data

We are now ready to add API routes to our webserver by using Flask's `route()` decorator with a path and a list of HTTP methods or verbs (`GET`, `PUT`, `POST`, etc.) as parameters:

```python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__);

@app.route('/users', methods=['GET'])
def get_users():
  return 'Get users'


@app.route('/users', methods=['DELETE'])
def delete_user():
  return 'Delete a user'
```

This code will enable calls to the `/users` API route for both the `GET` and `DELETE` methods.

To return JSON data, we will need to import `jsonify`, a function from Flask that can convert lists and dictionaries to JSON and send it in the response together with the correct Content-Type header (`application/json`):

```python
from flask import Flask, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__);

@app.route('/users', methods=['GET'])
def get_users():
  return jsonify([
        {'id': 546, 'username': 'John'},
        {'id': 894, 'username': 'Mary'},
        {'id': 326, 'username': 'Jane'}
    ])


@app.route('/users', methods=['DELETE'])
def delete_user():
    return jsonify({'result': 'success'})
```

Of course, this code is quite basic, and the two routes we created should probably load the list of users and delete users from a database before returning a result. But this is out of the scope of this small tutorial.

## 4. Run your API web server

One last line of code is required for our code to run the webserver:

`app.run()`

Calling Flask instance `run()` function will run the webserver and listen on the default port 5000.

Here is the final code after putting everything together:

```python
from flask import Flask, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__);

@app.route('/users', methods=['GET'])
def get_users():
  return jsonify([
        {'id': 546, 'username': 'John'},
        {'id': 894, 'username': 'Mary'},
        {'id': 326, 'username': 'Jane'}
    ])


@app.route('/users', methods=['DELETE'])
def delete_user():
    return jsonify({'result': 'success'})

app.run()
```

You can now run your server with the following command:

`python api.py`

Your API is available on http://localhost:5000. You can do a test call to the following API endpoints `GET /users` and `DELETE /users` using your favorite tool (here, Insomnia) and see the returned response:

![Delete users call response preview{993x408}](/images/tutorials/python-api-mocking/api-delete-users-call.png)

## Speed up development with API mocking

Working with an API can be challenging. It could be unavailable for various reasons: the whole API is under development, some routes are missing, the documentation is outdated, the access is restricted to the production environment or behind a firewall, etc.

Instead of waiting for the API to be ready to be able to consume it, you could mock it using an API mocking tool like Mockoon.

API mocking is a technique that consists in imitating an unavailable API by simulating the endpoints and their responses. With this technique, you can have a running mock in no time and start calling it right away from your front-end or back-end application.

Mocking an API with Mockoon is easy and requires only some small steps to start working.
