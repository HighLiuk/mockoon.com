In this tutorial, you will learn how to create a basic REST API using the [Go](https://go.dev/) language and its HTTP web framework, [Gin](https://gin-gonic.com/). Golang is an open-source language supported by Google. Its simplicity and versatility make it very popular. As in any other language, you can create any application, like REST APIs.

> Before continuing, you can learn more about REST APIs in general, how they work, their components, etc. in our [series of tutorials](/articles/api-guide-what-are-api/)

Creating an API using this framework is easy, straightforward, and only requires the following basic steps.

## 1. Verify that Go is installed

To create a simple API using Go, we first need to verify that it is installed on your computer by running the following commands:

```sh-sessions
$ go version
go version go1.19 windows/amd64
```

Go to the [Golang](https://go.dev/dl/) website download page if the above command is unsuccessful.

## 2. Create a new Go file and a new module

To create a new Go application, you first need to create a new Go file in the folder of your choice. Let's name it `main.go` and add the following package declaration:

```go
package main
```

We will also need to create a module to manage our dependencies. To do so, run the following command in the same folder:

```sh-sessions
$ go mod init tutorial/api
go: creating new go.mod: module tutorial/api
go: to add module requirements and sums:
        go mod tidy
```

## 3. Add the required dependencies

As we will be using Gin to create our HTTP server, we need to add it as a dependency with `net/http`. To do so, add the following lines in the `main.go` file:

```go
package main

import (
    "net/http"
    "github.com/gin-gonic/gin"
)
```

## 4. Add the main method and create a web server

In our `main.go` file, we need to create a `main()` function that will be called on startup and initialize and run our HTTP server:

```go
func main() {
    router := gin.Default()

    // TODO define routes

    router.Run("localhost:8080")
}
```

This code will initialize a new Gin router and start the HTTP server on port 8080.

## 5. Create fake data for the GET route

We will not cover the setup and connection to a database in this tutorial. We will directly store and return fake data from a `GET /users` route.

First we need to declare a `user` struct to use with our in-memory data. Add the following code after the `import` section:

```go
type user struct {
    Id        int     `json:"id"`
    Username  string  `json:"username"`
}
```

Then, we can create a variable holding some random user data, here, an array of users with an `id` and a `username`:

```go
var users = []user{
    {Id: "546", Username: "John"},
    {Id: "894", Username: "Mary"},
    {Id: "326", Username: "Jane"},
}
```

## 6. Create a GET route

Next, we will need to add a new `GET /users` route returning our fake data. To do so, we need to use `router.GET` in the `main` function, and add a `getUsers` function returning our fake data formatted as JSON:

```go
func getUsers(c *gin.Context) {
    c.IndentedJSON(http.StatusOK, users)
}

func main() {
    router := gin.Default()

    // new `GET /users` route associated with our `getUsers` function
    router.GET("/users", getUsers)

    router.Run("localhost:8080")
}
```

Here is the full and final code of our small web server and `GET /users` route:

```go
package main

import (
    "net/http"
    "github.com/gin-gonic/gin"
)

type user struct {
    Id        int     `json:"id"`
    Username  string  `json:"username"`
}

var users = []user{
    {Id: 546, Username: "John"},
    {Id: 894, Username: "Mary"},
    {Id: 326, Username: "Jane"},
}

func getUsers(c *gin.Context) {
    c.IndentedJSON(http.StatusOK, users)
}

func main() {
    router := gin.Default()

    // new `GET /users` route associated with our `getUsers` function
    router.GET("/users", getUsers)

    router.Run("localhost:8080")
}
```

## 7. Track dependency

Before running our code, we must track the Gin module as a dependency. For this, run the following command:

```sh-sessions
$ go get .
go: downloading github.com/gin-gonic/gin v1.8.1
...
go: added github.com/gin-gonic/gin v1.8.1
...
```

This will add the Gin module as a dependency of our module.

## 8. Run the server

We now have a basic setup that allows us to run the application and test our endpoints.

To run the Golang application and Gin HTTP server, run the following command:

```sh-sessions
$ go run .
...
[GIN-debug] GET    /users       --> main.getUsers (3 handlers)
...
```

You can verify that your routes are correctly created in the debug output of the command.
Your API is now available on http://localhost:8080.

## 7. Test your endpoints

You can do a test call to the following `GET /users` endpoint and see the returned response:

![Get users call response preview{993x408}](/images/tutorials/golang-gin-api-mocking/api-get-users-call.png)

Of course, this code is quite basic, and the route we created should probably load the list of users from a database before returning a result. But this is out of the scope of this small tutorial.

## Speed up development with API mocking

Working with an API can be challenging. It could be unavailable for various reasons: the whole API is under development, some routes are missing, the documentation is outdated, the access is restricted to the production environment or behind a firewall, etc.

Instead of waiting for the API to be ready to be able to consume it, you could mock it using an API mocking tool like Mockoon.

API mocking is a technique that consists in imitating an unavailable API by simulating the endpoints and their responses. With this technique, you can have a running mock in no time and start calling it right away from your front-end or back-end application.

Mocking an API with Mockoon is easy and requires only some small steps to start working.
