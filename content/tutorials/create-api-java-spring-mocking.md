In this tutorial, you will learn how to create a basic REST API using Java's [Spring](https://spring.io/) framework. Spring is one of the most popular Java frameworks for web applications development and REST API creation.

> Before continuing, you can learn more about REST APIs in general, how they work, their components, etc. in our [series of tutorials](/articles/api-guide-what-are-api/)

Creating an API using this framework is easy, straightforward, and only requires the following basic steps.

## 1. Verify that the JDK is installed

To create a simple API using Spring, we first need to verify that the JDK is installed by running the following command:

```sh-sessions
$ javac -version
javac 18.0.1
```

Go to [Oracle's website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) to install the JDK if the above command is unsuccessful.

## 2. Generate a new application with Spring Initializr

To speed up development, we can use Spring's own application generator called [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/) to generate a new application with all the configuration needed to create an API. Please note that we are adding Spring Web as a dependency which contains all the needed libraries to create web applications and APIs. We didn't modify any other options except the Java version (18).

![Generate an application with Spring Initializr{797x480}](/images/tutorials/java-spring-api-mocking/spring-initializr.png)

After clicking on the "Generate" button, the generator will download a zip file containing a new project. Extract it, and open the project with your favorite IDE (IntelliJ, Eclipse, etc.).

## 3. Add a new Spring controller

To be able to add routes to our new API, we first need to create a new controller. To do so, create a new 'UsersController.java' file in your `./src/main/java/com/example/demo` folder.

In this file, we first need to use the same package name as the main `DemoApplication.java` file and import the relevant annotations, `GetMapping` and `RestController`:

```java
package com.example.demo;

import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;
```

We can then create a new `UsersController` class to handle our `/users` routes:

```java
package com.example.demo;

import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
public class UsersController {

}
```

The class needs to be annotated with `@RestController`. It allows Spring to use our class as a web requests handler.

## 3. Add API routes and return JSON data

We are now ready to add API routes to our controller by adding methods and Spring annotations. There are annotations for each type of HTTP method, `@GetMapping`, `@PostMapping`, etc.

```java
package com.example.demo;

import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.DeleteMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
public class UsersController {
  @GetMapping("/users")
  public String getUsers() {
    return "Get users";
  }

  @DeleteMapping("/users")
  public String deleteUser() {
    return "Delete a user";
  }
}
```

This code will enable calls to the `/users` API route for both the `GET` and `DELETE` HTTP methods and use respectively the `getUsers` and `deleteUser` methods to handle the requests on those routes. For now, our routes only return simple strings. Let's return a list of users from the `GET /users` route by adding a simple `User` class and modifying our `getUsers` method accordingly:

```java
package com.example.demo;

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.DeleteMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

class User {
  public int id;
  public String username;

  public User(int id, String username) {
    this.id = id;
    this.username = username;
  }
}

@RestController
public class UsersController {
  @GetMapping("/users")
  public List<User> getUsers() {
    List<User> list = new ArrayList<User>();
    list.add(new User(546, "John"));
    list.add(new User(894, "Mary"));
    list.add(new User(326, "Jane"));
    return list;
  }

  @DeleteMapping("/users")
  public String deleteUser() {
    return "Delete a user";
  }
}
```

We can also return a JSON message from the `DELETE /users` route by returning a simple `Map`:

```java
package com.example.demo;

import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Collections;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Map;

import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.DeleteMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

class User {
  public int id;
  public String username;

  public User(int id, String username) {
    this.id = id;
    this.username = username;
  }
}

@RestController
public class UsersController {

  @GetMapping("/users")
  public List<User> getUsers() {
    List<User> list = new ArrayList<User>();
    list.add(new User(546, "John"));
    list.add(new User(894, "Mary"));
    list.add(new User(326, "Jane"));
    return list;
  }

  @DeleteMapping("/users")
  public Map<String, String> deleteUser() {
    return Collections.singletonMap("result", "success");
  }
}
```

Please note that Spring will automatically handle the JSON serialization of our lists and objects and send the correct `Content-Type: application/json` header.

Of course, this code is quite basic, and the two routes we created should probably load the list of users and delete users from a database before returning a result. But this is out of the scope of this small tutorial.

## 4. Run your web server

You can now run your new API server by running the following Maven command:

```sh-sessions
$ ./mvnw spring-boot:run
...
[INFO] Building demo 0.0.1-SNAPSHOT
...
  .   ____          _            __ _ _
 /\\ / ___'_ __ _ _(_)_ __  __ _ \ \ \ \
( ( )\___ | '_ | '_| | '_ \/ _` | \ \ \ \
 \\/  ___)| |_)| | | | | || (_| |  ) ) ) )
  '  |____| .__|_| |_|_| |_\__, | / / / /
 =========|_|==============|___/=/_/_/_/
 :: Spring Boot ::                (v2.6.7)
...
2022-04-27 08:57:58.474  INFO 1736 --- [nio-8080-exec-1] o.s.web.servlet.DispatcherServlet: Completed initialization in 0 ms
```

Your API is available on http://localhost:8080. You can do a test call to the following API endpoints `GET /users` and `DELETE /users` using your favorite tool (here, Insomnia) and see the returned response:

## Speed up development with API mocking

Working with an API can be challenging. It could be unavailable for various reasons: the whole API is under development, some routes are missing, the documentation is outdated, the access is restricted to the production environment or behind a firewall, etc.

Instead of waiting for the API to be ready to be able to consume it, you could mock it using an API mocking tool like Mockoon.

API mocking is a technique that consists in imitating an unavailable API by simulating the endpoints and their responses. With this technique, you can have a running mock in no time and start calling it right away from your front-end or back-end application.

Mocking an API with Mockoon is easy and requires only some small steps to start working.
