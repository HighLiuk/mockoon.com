## Mockoon joins GitHub Accelerator

We are excited to announce that we have been [accepted to the first GitHub Accelerator cohort](https://github.blog/2023-04-12-github-accelerator-our-first-cohort-and-whats-next/). This is a major milestone for our project and we are honored to be a part of such an amazing community of developers.

In addition to Mockoon, [19 other awesome open-source projects](https://github.blog/2023-04-12-github-accelerator-our-first-cohort-and-whats-next/#meet-the-20-projects-in-github-accelerator) have been selected. We look forward to collaborating with them throughout the program.

## Sponsoring and pro plan

Because developing open-source softwares is not free, we (still) need your help to guarantee a bright future for our favorite raccoon.
If you like our work, you can support us in multiple ways:

- Spread the word! The more, the merrier üôÇ.
- [Sponsor us](https://github.com/sponsors/mockoon) and join all the [Sponsors and Backers](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/blob/main/backers.md) who helped this project over time. It's a great way to support us and show your brand in front of thousands of developers interested in APIs.
- Subscribe to our [enterprise services](/enterprise/): live support, applications deployment, bug prioritization, etc. Do not hesitate to reach out if your company needs such services.

We are also working on a [Pro plan](/pro/) available later this year. It will offer exciting features such as data synchronization and AI-powered API mocks generation. Stay tuned!
