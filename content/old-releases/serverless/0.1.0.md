  title: Serverless release 0.1.0
  description: Discover Mockoon Serverless library first 0.1.0 release adding a new NPM package to easily run your mock APIs in cloud functions and serverless environments
---

This is the first release of the new [@mockoon/serverless package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mockoon/serverless). It helps you run your mock APIs in cloud functions and serverless environments: AWS Lambda, GCP/Firebase Functions, etc.

The library exposes a `MockoonServerless` class with functions helping you generate the required `RequestListener` or `handler`, depending on the cloud provider you are using.

Head over to the [dedicated documentation](https://github.com/mockoon/mockoon/tree/main/packages/serverless) to learn more.
