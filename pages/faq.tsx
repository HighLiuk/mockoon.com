              <h3>How does Mockoon mock API creation works?</h3>
              <p>
                Unlike many other mocking tools, Mockoon is a desktop
                application using a local Node.js server to avoid latency and
                the hassle of deploying through a remote service.
              </p>
              <h3>Does Mockoon need elevated rights to run?</h3>
              <p>
                No, Mockoon can be run in most environments by regular
                non-privileged users.
              </p>
              <h3>Does Mockoon work behind a company firewall?</h3>
              <p>
                Mockoon creates a local mock server running on Node.js and does
                not require internet access. The server is then made available
                on all local network adapters (localhost, 127.0.0.1,
                192.168.x.x, etc.) on the port you define. If the machine on
                which Mockoon is running has open ports on the local network,
                other users will be able to access it.
              </p>
              <h3>Does Mockoon require an active internet connection?</h3>
              <p>
                No, you don't need an internet connection to use Mockoon.
                Everything runs locally.
              </p>
              <h3>Do you need an account to create mock APIs?</h3>
              <p>
                No, you don't need to sign up or create an account to use
                Mockoon.
              </p>
              <h3>Does Mockoon offer a CLI?</h3>
              <p>
                Yes, Mockoon has an <a href='/cli/'>official CLI</a> that allows
                you to run all your mock APIs in any headless or automated
                environment: servers, CI, GitHub Actions, Docker containers,
                etc. A Docker image is also available on{' '}

                we are also collecting some events happening in the application.

                None of your mock API, routes or URLs are collected. You can
