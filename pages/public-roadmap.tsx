              Our roadmap is hosted on GitHub. You can view it by clicking on
              the button above.

              too. This is where you can upvote them and contribute to the
              discussions.

            <h3>What are the different steps?</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <span className='fw-bold'>Backlog:</span> contains features that
                are potential candidates due to their number of upvotes. Number
                of upvotes is only one indicator, and we may add features with
                less upvotes if they are more relevant to the project. We avoid
                adding too many features to the backlog as they may never get
                implemented.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span className='fw-bold'>Analysis/POC:</span> contains the
                features that we are currently analyzing. They may be
                transferred to "To do" or be rejected if we realize they are not
                a good fit.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span className='fw-bold'>To do:</span> planned features and
                tasks.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span className='fw-bold'>In progress:</span> features currently
                being worked on by the maintainers or external contributors.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span className='fw-bold'>Done:</span> contains the features and
                bug fixes merged to the main branch. As Mockoon is mainly a
                desktop application, releases happen less often than for web
                applications. The repository's main branch is stable but may
                contain features not yet released.
              </li>
            </ul>

              Note: some work may not be listed on the roadmap. It is the case
              for chores like dependencies updates, or work happening on private
              repositories (backend, cloud offering, etc.).
